## Issues, suggestions and feature requests

-   ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance is a problem when handling large files. In part, this is a limitation of the SheetJs free version.
    The Pro version might be a solution.

-   ‚ö†Ô∏è Strange behaviour with the spreadsheet's horizontal scrollbar when using Mozilla Firefox. This seems unrelated to
    this widget's logic as per this
    [Stack Overflow post](https://superuser.com/questions/1720362/firefox-scroll-bar-disappearing).

-   ‚ö†Ô∏è This widget contains some limitations, namely, the converstion method ignores the styles - "The underlying grid
    component includes many additional features that work with SheetJS Pro." -
    ![Reference Documentation](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/demos/grid/xs).

-   üôå Feel free to suggest us new features or report bugs.
